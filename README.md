## The new and improved version of cordial.

### Added features include:

 - Grid-based posts view
 - Non-url-php-style based routing, so for example a user page might be /user/j4cobgarby, instead of the previous /user?id=1 - much easier to write!
 - A better authentication system at each route
 - Authentication system includes email and full name now
