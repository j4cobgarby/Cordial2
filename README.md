## The new and improved version of cordial.

### Added features include:

 - Grid-based posts view
 - Non-url-php-style based routing, so for example a user page might be `/user/j4cobgarby`, instead of the previous `/user?id=1` - much easier to write!
 - A better authentication system at each route
 - Authentication system includes email and full name now
