some stuff that i need to do

if anyone else wants to do any of these, fork cordial

:)

 - in no particular order -

make it so you can cancel a post edit
make some sort of system for profile pictures or something
make the edit button animation a bit smoother
maybe make the bookmark icon kind of slide down like set the transform origin
  to the top of it and scaling it or something
make posts either get auto loaded as you scroll down or get loaded by clicking
  the button

** this is by no means everything that has to be done, by a long way
